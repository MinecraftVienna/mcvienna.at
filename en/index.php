                    <br /><br />Minecraft is a computergame where players can - alone or together - construct online lots of creative worlds out of several different building blocks.
                    <br /><br />Starting from the first district, also called "Innere Stadt", there are built landmarks, streets and buildings bit by bit in minute detail like the original. For that purpose sattelite images, maps as well as photos made at that places are used. In this manner there will be built more and more quarters of the capital city during the next months and years.

                    <br /><br />In order to be able to coordinate better, the creative minds around Founder Stefan Riedmann and Serveradministrator Harald Niemeczek teamed up to the registred association Minecraft Vienna.
                    <br /><br />Since the beginning of 2015 Wien-Kanal is supporting this innovative Project. Especially those parts of the Viennese Canal Network that can be viewed at the 3rd Man Tour, as well as parts of the Wien River are included in the three-dimensional world made out of uncountable numbers of Blocks.
