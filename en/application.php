									We are always looking for skilled builders who support us at our project.
									
									Due to the high level that we are working at we have high expectations of our applicants .
									<br /><br />
									The application process follows these three steps:
									<ul>
										<li>
											You send us a mail to <a href="mailto:office@mcvienna.at?subject=Application_YourIngameName&amp">office@mcvienna.at</a>, Subject Application_YourIngameName 
											In your e-mail you include your name, age, location, how much time you want to spend and your motivation for the application. 
											The part with the motivation is important, one-liners will be deleted immediately.
										</li>
											<br />
										<li>
											After that we arrange an appointment, at which you can schow your skills under our watchful eyes and with the help of our city planners.
											You usually start outside of the center of the city with a simple, straight building and gradually work your way up to government buildings.
											<!--Begleitend erhÃ¤ltst Du in unserem Forum Tipps und Hilfe.-->
										</li>
										<br />
										<li>
											If we are satisfied with your work, we will incorporate you completely into the building team. You then have more freedom at selecting projects 
											and one day you will be able to teach new builders yourself. Then we will invite you to our public appearances and also occasionally spend you a beer or some lemonade.
										</li>
									</ul>
