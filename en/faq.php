								<p>
									<b>When will ......... be built?</b>
									<br /><br />
									Our Vienna is built from the center out, it was started with the 1st district Innere Stadt. At the moment we are still working on that,
									we don't know how long it will take. After that it is planned to build the inner districts as well as the Donaucity, a part of 22nd District Donaustadt.
									Due to the sheer size of that project we cannot say anything about the time a special building will be completed.
									If a building is really important to you, you can <a href="/en/bewerbung.php">apply</a> to become part of the building team and build it on your own. 
									<br />
									The current progress of construction work can be viewed at our <a href="http://mc.mcvienna.at:8123/" target="_blank">Livemap</a>.

                    Wer hat das Projekt gegr&uuml;ndet?
                    Stefan Riedmann, bekannt als DrJosephMosch, hat mit dem Nachbau bereits im Oktober 2013 begonnen, damals noch allein im Singleplayer. Nachdem das Projekt zu gro&szlig; f&uuml;r nur eine Person geworden ist, schloss er sich im April 2014 mit Harald zusammen um die Welt auf einen Server zu bringen. Bis November 2014 ist das Team auf 6 Personen angewachsen.
